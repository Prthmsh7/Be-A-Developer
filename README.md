## Guide for the contributors
How to contribute : fork the repo, clone the forked repo, make a significant contribution, make a PR.
Make sure you give a proper commit message to your PR, so it is easier to review your contribution.
Note : Your PR will be accepted in a while if it is significant.

Make sure to follow a structure while contributing.
Structure : 
   -TOPIC
      -readme.md(explains all the stuff, gives a roadmap to follow)(list down and drop the links of the necessary resources)
      -mini-projects (you can add your mini projects that you have built.)
      -sub-topic1/
      -sub-topic2/ and so on ...
