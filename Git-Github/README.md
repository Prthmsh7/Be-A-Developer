# Git & GitHub

Welcome to the Git and GitHub section! This guide will help you understand version control systems that are essential for any developer.

## What are Git and GitHub?

**Git** is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes in your code and collaborate with others. It lets you save snapshots of your project and return to them when needed.

**GitHub** is a web-based platform built around Git that adds collaboration features, issue tracking, project management, and more. It's where many open-source projects live and where developers showcase their work.

## Learning Path

### Git Basics

1. **Setting Up**
   - Installing Git
   - Configuring your identity
   - Basic terminal/command line navigation

2. **Core Concepts**
   - Repositories
   - Commits
   - Branches
   - The staging area (index)
   - Working directory

3. **Essential Commands**
   - `git init` - Create a new repository
   - `git clone` - Copy a repository
   - `git add` - Stage changes
   - `git commit` - Record changes
   - `git status` - Check status
   - `git log` - View history
   - `git diff` - See changes
   - `git checkout` - Switch branches

4. **Branching and Merging**
   - Creating branches
   - Switching between branches
   - Merging branches
   - Resolving merge conflicts

### GitHub Skills

1. **Account Setup**
   - Creating an account
   - Setting up SSH keys
   - Configuring profile

2. **Remote Repositories**
   - `git remote` - Managing remotes
   - `git push` - Uploading changes
   - `git pull` - Downloading changes
   - `git fetch` - Getting updates

3. **Collaboration**
   - Forking repositories
   - Creating pull requests
   - Code reviews
   - Issues and discussions

4. **GitHub Features**
   - GitHub Pages
   - GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
   - Project boards
   - GitHub Discussions

### Advanced Git

1. **History Manipulation**
   - Interactive rebase
   - Cherry-picking
   - Reset vs Revert
   - Reflog

2. **Git Workflows**
   - Feature branch workflow
   - Gitflow
   - Trunk-based development
   - Fork and pull model

3. **Git Internals**
   - Objects and references
   - Git's data model
   - Hooks
   - Custom commands

## Common Workflows

### Individual Development

```
# Start a new feature
git checkout -b new-feature main

# Make changes
# ... edit files ...

# Stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Push to remote
git push -u origin new-feature
```

### Team Collaboration

```
# Update your local copy
git checkout main
git pull

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b new-feature

# Make changes and commit
# ... edit files ...
git add .
git commit -m "Implement feature"

# Stay up to date with main
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Push to remote
git push -u origin new-feature

# Create pull request on GitHub
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Commit Often**: Make small, focused commits rather than large changes
2. **Write Good Messages**: Clear commit messages help everyone understand changes
3. **Pull Before Push**: Always update your local copy before pushing
4. **Use Branches**: Keep your work organized with feature branches
5. **Learn From Mistakes**: Git lets you recover from almost any mistake

Remember that Git has a learning curve, but it becomes second nature with practice. Don't be afraid to experiment - you can always use `git reflog` to find your way back if you get lost.
