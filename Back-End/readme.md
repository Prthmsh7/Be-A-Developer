# Back-End Development

Welcome to the back-end development section! This area covers everything you need to build robust server-side applications that power websites and web applications.

## What is Back-End Development?

Back-end development focuses on the server side of applications - the part users don't see directly. It involves creating APIs, managing databases, handling authentication, processing data, and ensuring the application runs smoothly.
