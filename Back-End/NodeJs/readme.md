node js by freecodecamp - https://youtu.be/Oe421EPjeBE?si=sZ3EKBVL5Jd-4MPe

#### PS: Practise side by side and try to code  whatever you have learnt from that single vedio  , follow this step in each vedio.  Do not binge-watch.

### Next Step - Learn about CRUD Operation and build projects

CRUD Operations - https://youtu.be/_7UQPve99r4?si=47yX3jflPXDL9cxG

Project Ideas - Try to start with a basic CRUD APP if you are a beginner and you should build atleast three project by your own from the given list of projects.
<br>
-Quiz APP (Must if you are a beginner)
<br>
-Blog App
<br>
-Movie Show Booking APP
<br>
-Ecommerce App
<br>
-Food Delivery App
<br>
-Job Finder App
<br>
-Event Scheduling App
<br>
-Wallet App
<br>

(try to create all the apis by your own, you will get to learn more new things, you can take help from youtube vedios, mostly all are good you can search any project by its name.)

#### If you have reached till here congrats ! You have covered most of the things that are required to build a full stack web app with nodejs.

### Let's move one step further-
#### Now it's time to go deep dive in node js - learn how to build your own npm packages and cli's

<br>
I also created a CLI Tool, Servobase which is used for setting up a express nodejs backend app fastly .

<br>
Some Personal Advice - decide any one project and then whatever you are learning from a particular vedio or a documentation try to implement that thing as a feature in your project.
after following all the things that I've mentioned above choose any one project and try to make it as complex as possible by introducing new features by yourself. I can give one example of building your own web based IDE or a replit clone .
for more unique and complex projects Piyush Garg Youtube channel is best .
