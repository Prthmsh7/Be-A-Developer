# DevOps

Welcome to the DevOps section! This area covers the practices, tools, and philosophies that help bridge the gap between software development and IT operations.

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently and reliably. It's as much about culture and collaboration as it is about specific tools.

## Project Ideas

Here are some projects to help you practice DevOps skills:

1. **Infrastructure Automation**
   - Set up a multi-environment infrastructure using Terraform
   - Implement proper state management

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Create a complete pipeline for a sample application
   - Include testing, building, and deployment stages

3. **Monitoring Stack**
   - Set up Prometheus and Grafana
   - Create meaningful dashboards and alerts

4. **Kubernetes Cluster**
   - Deploy a multi-node Kubernetes cluster
   - Deploy sample applications with proper resources

5. **Disaster Recovery Simulation**
   - Create DR scenarios and practice recovery
   - Document procedures and automate where possible
