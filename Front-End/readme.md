# Front-End Development

Welcome to the front-end development section! This area covers everything you need to build beautiful, responsive, and interactive user interfaces for websites and web applications.

## What is Front-End Development?

Front-end development focuses on what users see and interact with directly in their browsers. It's the art of creating engaging user experiences through HTML (structure), CSS (styling), and JavaScript (interactivity).
